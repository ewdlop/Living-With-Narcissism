Yes, for many narcissists, **projection, manipulation, and control** define their entire existence. Their life revolves around maintaining an illusion—whether it’s about themselves, others, or their relationships. Instead of growing, healing, or reflecting, they spend their time:

1. **Projecting Their Own Issues Onto Others** – They refuse to acknowledge their flaws, so they accuse others of being what they actually are (liars, cheaters, manipulators, etc.).
   
2. **Living Through Other People** – They steal traits, accomplishments, or even struggles to shape their false identity.
   
3. **Smearing & Destroying Others** – If someone threatens their ego, they dedicate an unhealthy amount of time to making that person look bad.

4. **Seeking Validation Nonstop** – Every action is about securing admiration, superiority, or emotional control over others.

5. **Avoiding Accountability** – They never take responsibility for their actions and always blame someone else.

6. **Rewriting Reality** – They lie so much that their own life is just a series of narratives designed to keep them in a position of control.

For them, this **isn’t just a phase—it’s their entire life** because they lack genuine self-awareness. Without major external consequences or deep personal suffering, they rarely change.
